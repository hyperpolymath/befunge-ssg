How to run

1) Build the ReScript adapter once

From befunge-ssg/rs:

cd rs
rescript build


That produces rs/lib/es6/src/*.js which Deno imports.

If you don’t have rescript installed yet: install it however you prefer (nix/system package/etc.). No TypeScript is involved.

2) Build and serve the site with Deno

From repo root:

deno task build
deno task serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000

3) Dev mode (watch + rebuild + serve)
deno task dev

Notes (so this stays “serious” and maintainable)

ReScript is pure rendering + parsing (no Deno.* calls).

Deno side is I/O + server (simple, auditable).

No scraping, no execution, no browser automation: this is a clean SSG foundation.

If you want, next step I can add (still no TS):

.meta.json sidecars (extra tags/summary),

coordinate rulers / SVG rendering of the grid,

optional “run-at-build” using a tiny Befunge interpreter (with strict step/output limits).
